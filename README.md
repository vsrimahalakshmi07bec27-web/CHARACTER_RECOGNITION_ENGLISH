# CHARACTER_RECOGNITION_ENGLISH
This project implements a Character Recognition System using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with image segmentation techniques.The system detects and recognizes individual alphanumeric characters (0–9, A–Z, a–z) from input images and generates annotated output with bounding boxes and predicted labels.
